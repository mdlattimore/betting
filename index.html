                <h2>Welcome</h2>
                <p>This site is essentially a sports betting calculator. It tracks NFL and NCAA football games. Choose either "NFL" or "NCAAF" then enter the amount of your bet, click "Go" and betting lines for every covered game will be displayed along with the payouts for the bet you entered. Generally, you'll see the payouts for moneyline, spread, and over/under bets. Occasionally, one of the categories won't be available for a particular game or a game may be missing in its entirety (more likely to occur with NCAA games). The lines are taken from the Draftkings sportsbook.</p> 
                <p>I, myself, am not a gambler, but I am fascinated by the science (and art) of odds-making. These pages are just a way for me to explore that. NOTE: This site is only for entertainment and study and <b>SHOULD NOT</b> be used as the basis for actual wagers. These odds are updated only once per week, usually the day prior to the beginning of the current week of the season. <b>IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE LINES ARE NOT UP TO DATE AND/OR ARE NOT ACCURATE</b>. If you want to know more about the "how" behind this calculator, read on, especially if you are interested in how the pages were developed. Otherwise, click one of the links below and explore.</p>

                <h2>Nerd Stuff</h2>
                <p>These pages were developed using the new-ish PyScript framework. PyScript, an open source framework sponsored primarily by Anaconda (who also provides some of the developers on the team), allows Python to run in the web browser. It is still in the early stages of development but is already showing great promise bringing the best parts of the Python eco-system to the browser. No, it's not as fast or light as JavaScript, but it has the decided advantage of not being JavaScript (and there is work underway to bring the Micro-Python interpreter to PyScript which will cut the initial download size and overhead drastically).</p>
                <p>The data is taken from the api at <a href="https://the-odds-api.com">odds-api</a>. When planning out the pages, I had to decide whether to fetch the data from the api each time the page is accessed or feed data to the program logic from a static json file (by the way, making HTTP requests from within PyScript is a little bit of a hack, though less so now than early on). Fetching on the fly would ensure the most up-to-date info. However, sportsbook apis have very limited free tiers (most have none at all), so to make sure I stay within the free limits, I run a utility script once a week that pulls the data and converts it into a json schema that works with the python code. After pushing the json to GitHub (see the repo <a href="https://github.com/mdlattimore/betting">here</a>), the result is, in essence, a (very) simple, serverless web app running on GitHub pages.</p>  
                <p>The page layout and design is, I know, pretty horrible. I'm just not any good at it. I used Bootstrap for layout and some styling so it is, at the very least, readable. I may pretty it up later.</p>
